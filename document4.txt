I told you I'd change, even
when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else
as good as you
I need you to stay,
need you to stay, hey (Oh)
I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Oh, I'll be fucked up
if you can't be right here
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Oh, I'll be fucked up
if you can't be right here
